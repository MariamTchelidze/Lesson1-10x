        <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>

        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a <a href="#">website</a> for the <a href="#">Internet</a> (<a href="#">World Wide Web</a>) or an <a href="#">intranet</a> (a private network).<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Web development can range from developing a simple single <a href="#">static page</a> of <a href="#">plain text</a> to complex <a href="#">web applications</a>, <a href="#">electronic businesses</a>, and <a href="#">social network services</a>. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include <a href="#">Web engineering</a>, <a href="#">Web design</a>, <a href="#">Web content development</a>, client liaison, <a href="#">client-side</a>/<a href="#">server-side scripting</a>, <a href="#">Web server</a> and <a href="#">network security</a> configuration, and <a href="#">e-commerce</a> development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <a href="#">markup</a> and <a href="#">coding<sup>[2]</sup></a>. Web development may use <a href="#">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a href="#">Web developers</a>) and follow standard methods like <a href="#">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web sites.<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <a href="#">graphic designer</a> or <a href="#">information systems</a> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <a href="#">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.<a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

        <p><strong>Origin/ Web 1.0</strong></p>
        <p>
            <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the <a href="#">World Wide Web</a> in 1989 at CERN.<a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <a href="#">HTML</a> was developed in 1993.<sup>[6]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="#">HTTP</a>, HTML and URI.[8]
